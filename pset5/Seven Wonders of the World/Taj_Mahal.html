        <h1 class="header"><i>Taj Mahal</i></h1>
        <h1 class="margintop"><i class="left4">This mausoleum complex in Agra, India, is regarded as one of the world’s most iconic monuments and is perhaps the finest example of Mughal architecture. It was built by Emperor Shah Jahān (reigned &emsp; 1628–58) to honor his wife Mumtāz Maḥal &emsp; &emsp; (“Chosen One of the Palace”), who died &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;in 1631 giving birth to their 14th child. It &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; took about 22 years and 20,000 workers &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp; to construct the complex, which &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; includes an immense garden &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; with a reflecting pool.</i></h1>
        <h1 class="margintop"><i class="right2"> The mausoleum is made of white marble that features semiprecious stones in geometric and floral patterns. Its majestic central dome is surrounded by four smaller domes. According to some reports, Shah &emsp; Jahān wished to have his own mausoleum made &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;out of black marble. However, he was deposed &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; by one of his sons before any work began.</i></h1>
